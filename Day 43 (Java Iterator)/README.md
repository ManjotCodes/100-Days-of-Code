# Question 

In this problem you need to complete a method func. The method takes an ArrayList as input. In that ArrayList there is one or more integer numbers, then there is a special string "###", after that there are one or more other strings. A sample ArrayList may look like this:

element[0]=>42

element[1]=>10

element[2]=>"###"

element[3]=>"Hello"

element[4]=>"Java"

You have to modify the func method by editing at most 2 lines so that the code only prints the elements after the special string "###". For the sample above the output will be:

Hello

Java

Note: The stdin doesn't contain the string "###", it is added in the main method.

To restore the original code in the editor, click the top left icon on the editor and create a new buffer.
