Static in Java

# 1) Java static Variable

If you declare any variable as static, it is known as a static variable.

The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects (which is not unique for each object), for example, the company name of employees, college name of students, etc.
The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading.

Advantages of static variable

It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).


# 2) Java static method

If you apply static keyword with any method, it is known as static method.


A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.

A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.

A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.
