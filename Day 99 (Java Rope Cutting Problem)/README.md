Given a rope of length n, you need to find the maximum number of pieces
you can make such that the length of every piece is in set {a, b, c} for
the given three values a, b, c

## Examples
```
Input: n=23, a=12, b=11, c=9
Output: 2
Explaination: We make 2 pieces of length 11 and 12.

Input: n=5, a=2, b=5, c=1
Output: 5
Explaination: We make 5 pieces of length 1 each.
