# Java throw keyword

The Java throw keyword is used to throw an exception explicitly.

We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. The Exception has some message with it that provides the error description. These exceptions may be related to user inputs, server, etc.

We can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions in Java by throw keyword. It is mainly used to throw a custom exception. We will discuss custom exceptions later in this section.

We can also define our own set of conditions and throw an exception explicitly using throw keyword. For example, we can throw ArithmeticException if we divide a number by another number. Here, we just need to set the condition and throw exception using throw keyword.
