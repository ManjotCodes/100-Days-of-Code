# Inheritance in Java


Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

# Why use inheritance in java
For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
For Code Reusability.


# Terms used in Inheritance
Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class. It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class. You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.
