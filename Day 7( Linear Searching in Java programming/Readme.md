# Array in Java

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.

## Advantages

Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.

Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

## Types of Array in java

There are two types of array.

1. Single Dimensional Array

2. Multidimensional Array

Today I learnt about Linear Searching in Array using java

Linear search is used to search a key element from multiple elements. Linear search is less used today because it is slower than binary search and hashing.


Algorithm:

Step 1: Traverse the array

Step 2: Match the key element with array element

Step 3: If key element is found, return the index position of the array element

Step 4: If key element is not found, return -1
