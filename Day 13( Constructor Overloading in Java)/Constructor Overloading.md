# Day 13 (Constructor Overloading in Java)

In Java, we can overload constructors like methods. The constructor overloading can be defined as the concept of having more than one constructor with different parameters so that every constructor can perform a different task.

We need to understand the purpose of constructor overloading. Sometimes, we need to use multiple constructors to initialize the different values of the class.

We must also notice that the java compiler invokes a default constructor when we do not use any constructor in the class. However, the default constructor is not invoked if we have used any constructor in the class, whether it is default or parameterized. In this case, the java compiler throws an exception saying the constructor is undefined.

Now refer to the example in my Github Repository for better understanding.
