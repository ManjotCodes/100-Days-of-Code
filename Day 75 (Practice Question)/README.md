ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement:

Legendreâ€™s formula (Given p and n, find the largest x such that p^x divides n!)



Given an integer n and a prime number p, find the largest x such that px (p raised to power x) divides n! (factorial) 



Examples: 



ðŸ“Œ Input:  n = 10, p = 3



ðŸ“Œ Output: x = 4

34 divides 10! and 4 is the largest such power of 3.
