The locked code reads a single string denoting the name of a subclass of State (i.e., WestBengal, Karnataka, or AndhraPradesh), then tests the methods associated with that subclass. You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin.



## ðŸ“Œ Output Format



Output is handled for you by the locked code, which creates the object corresponding to the input string's class name and then prints the name returned by that class' national flower's whatsYourName method. You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout.
